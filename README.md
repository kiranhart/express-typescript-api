A quick to use template for creating backend apis using Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL and TypeORM.

## Contributing
This is a stripped down version of [This Repository](https://github.com/ljlm0402/typescript-express-starter)
I highly recommend taking a look at their version as it includes a cli for customizable installs.
